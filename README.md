# Super Dodger!

Super Dodger was a game I made in 2017 for my grade 11 Computer Science summative and is not reflective of my code now-a-days. Uploading it to github just for storage,
I'm probably never going to update this heh.

## Installation

Requires Pygame 2.0 to work. Download as zip and just click the SuperDodger.py to try it.
